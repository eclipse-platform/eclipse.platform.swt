/**
 * Test Widgets for memory leaks. Used when updating dispose logic.
 *
 * Due to lack of better alternative, the current mechanism creates & disposes a widget in a loop.
 * If the test makes it to the end without crashing your system, then you have no (major?) leaks.
 *
 * Run these on demand if updating dispose logic of a particular widget.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The tests are a bit long, so they're not part of the main test suite.
 * - Note, JNI != Java memory leaks. JNI leaks are not detected by Java profilers as they occur *outside* of the heap.
 *   Finding JNI leaks is not a trivial matter as typical C memory tools see the JVM as a memory leak itself.
 *   It's possible thou. Have not tried myself but see:
 *   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33334126/how-to-find-memory-leaks-in-java-jni-c-process
 *   https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/11/using-jemalloc-to-get-to-the-bottom-of-a-memory-leak/

	/**
	 * Create and dispose Browser instances.
	 *
	 * If this test runs at linear speed and passes, then it's fairly safe to say you have no memory leaks.
	 * A typical run will take 5 minutes.
	 *
	 * If you have a memory leak in the dispoal logic, then the loop eventually slows down and the test crashes.
	 * You would see 'memory pressure' errors. The Java process of the jUnit would grow significantly (100's of mbs)
	 * On my machine with Intel i7 & 16 GB of ram, this occurs at the ~420th iteration.
	 * (although with my testing, without memory leaks, it grows a little bit (by 100mb by end of test)).
