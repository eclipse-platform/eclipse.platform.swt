 * </p><p>
 * The ability to subclass outside of the allowed SWT classes
 * is intended purely to enable those not on the SWT development
 * team to implement patches in order to get around specific
 * limitations in advance of when those limitations can be
 * addressed by the team. Subclassing should not be attempted
 * without an intimate and detailed understanding of the hierarchy.
