/**
 * Instances of this class provide a bridge between application
 * code and assistive technology clients. Many platforms provide
 * default accessible behavior for most widgets, and this class
 * allows that default behavior to be overridden. Applications
 * can get the default Accessible object for a control by sending
 * it <code>getAccessible</code>, and then add an accessible listener
 * to override simple items like the name and help string, or they
 * can add an accessible control listener to override complex items.
 * As a rule of thumb, an application would only want to use the
 * accessible control listener to implement accessibility for a
 * custom control.
