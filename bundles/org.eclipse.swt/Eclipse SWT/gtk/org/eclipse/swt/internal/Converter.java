/**
 * About this class:
 * #################
 * This class implements the conversions between unicode characters
 * and the platform supported representation for characters.
 *
 * Note that, unicode characters which can not be found in the platform
 * encoding will be converted to an arbitrary platform specific character.
 *
 * This class is tested via: org.eclipse.swt.tests.gtk.Test_GtkTextEncoding
 *
 * About JNI &amp; string conversion:
 * #############################
 * - Regular JNI String conversion usually uses a modified UTF-8, see:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Modified_UTF-8
 * - And in JNI, normally (env*)->GetStringUTFChars(..) is used to convert a javaString into a C string.
 *     See: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/functions.html#GetStringUTFChars
 *
 * However, the modified UTF-8 only works well with C system functions as it doesn't contain embedded nulls
 * and is null terminated.
 *
 * But because the modified UTF-8 only supports up to 3 bytes (and not up to 4 as regular UTF-8), characters
 * that require 4 bytes (e.g emojos) are not translated properly from Java to C.
 *
 * To work around this issue, we convert the Java string to a byte array on the Java side manually and then  pass it to C.
 *   See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32205446/getting-true-utf-8-characters-in-java-jni
 *
 * Note:
 * Java uses UTF-16 Wide characters internally to represent a string.
 * C uses UTF-8 Multibyte characters (null terminated) to represent a string.
 *
 * About encoding on Linux/Gtk &amp; it's relevance to SWT:
 * ####################################################
 *
 * UTF-* = variable length encoding.
 *
 * UTF-8 = minimum is 8 bits, max is 6 bytes, but rarely goes beyond 4 bytes. Gtk &amp; most of web uses this.
 * UTF-16 = minimum is 16 bits. Java's string are stored this way.
 *          UTF-16 can be
 *            Big    Endian  : 65 = 00000000  01000001    # Human friendly, reads left to right.
 *            Little Endian  : 65 = 01000001  00000000    # Intel x86 and also AMD64 / x86-64 series of processors use the little-endian [1]
 *            											  #  i.e, we in SWT often have to deal with UTF-16 LE
 * Some terminology:
 * - "Code point" is the numerical value of unicode character.
 * - All of UTF-* have the same letter to code-point mapping,
 *   but UTF-8/16/32 have different "back-ends".
 *
 *   Illustration:
 *   (char) = (code point) = (back end).
 *       A =     65       = 01000001    	   UTF-8
 *       				  = 00000000  01000001 UTF-16 BE
 *       				  = 01000001  00000000 UTF-16 LE
 *
 * - Byte Order Marks (BOM) are a few bytes at the start of a *file* indicating which endianess is used.
 *   Problem: Gtk/webkit often don't give us BOM's.
 *   (further reading *3)
 *
 * - We can reliably encode character to a backend (A -> UTF-8/16), but the other way round is
 *   guess work since byte order marks are often missing and UTF-16 bits are technically valid UTF-8.
 *   (see Converter.heuristic for details).
 *   We could improve our heuristic by using something like http://jchardet.sourceforge.net/.
 *
 * - Glib has some conversion functions:
 *   g_utf16_to_utf8
 *   g_utf8_to_utf16
 *
 * - So does java: (e.g null terminated UTF-8)
 *   ("myString" + '\0').getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF-8)
 *
 * - I suggest using Java functions where possible to avoid memory leaks.
 *   (Yes, they happen and are big-pain-in-the-ass to find https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=533995)
 *
 *
 * Learning about encoding:
 * #########################
 * I suggest the following 3 videos to understand ASCII/UTF-8/UTF-16[LE|BE]/UTF-32 encoding:
 * Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4
 * Details:
 * Part-1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Sf1IhA0j4
 * Part-2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oYfv794R9s
 * Part-3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLBtrd9Ar28
 *
 * Also read all of this:
 * http://kunststube.net/encoding/
 * and this:
 * https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/
 *
 * And lastly, good utf-8 reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description
 *
 * You should now be a master of encoding. I wish you luck on your journey.

	 *   a byte sequence with many null bytes is likely UTF-16.
	 * - Valid UTF-8 technically can contain null bytes, but it's rare.
	 *
	 * Some times it can get confused if it receives two non-null bytes. e.g (E with two dots on top) = (UTF-16  [01,04])
	 * It can either mean a valid set of UTF-8 characters or a single UTF-16 character.
	 * This issue typically only occurs for very short sequences 1-5 characters of very special characters).
	 * Improving the heuristic for such corner cases is complicated. We'd have to implement a mechanism
