/**
 * Instances of this class are sent as a result of
 * keys being pressed and released on the keyboard.
 * <p>
 * When a key listener is added to a control, the control
 * will take part in widget traversal.  By default, all
 * traversal keys (such as the tab key and so on) are
 * delivered to the control.  In order for a control to take
 * part in traversal, it should listen for traversal events.
 * Otherwise, the user can traverse into a control but not
 * out.  Note that native controls such as table and tree
 * implement key traversal in the operating system.  It is
 * not necessary to add traversal listeners for these controls,
 * unless you want to override the default traversal.
