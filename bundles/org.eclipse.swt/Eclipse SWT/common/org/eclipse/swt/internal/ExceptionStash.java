/**
 * The intent of this class is to insulate SWT from exceptions occurring in
 * user's listeners, so that SWT remains stable and does not accidentally
 * crash JVM or enter some very broken state. The supposed use is:
 * <br>
 * <pre>void someSwtInternalFunction() {
 *     // Make a stash to collect all exceptions from user listeners
 *     try (ExceptionStash exceptions = new ExceptionStash ()) {
 *         // Perform some action that may call a throwing user's listener
 *         try {
 *            sendEvent(SWT.SomeEvent);
 *         } catch (Error | RuntimeException ex) {
 *             exceptions.stash (ex);
 *         }
 *
 *         // Do some important SWT stuff that you would normally do in
 *         // 'finally' clause. With 'ExceptionStash' you can interleave
 *         // important things with listeners without making code ugly.
 *         MakeSureThingsDontBreak();
 *
 *         // Perform another action that may call a throwing user's listener.
 *         // Done in an independent 'try' block to make sure that all events
 *         // are sent regardless of exceptions in some of the listeners.
 *         try {
 *            askWidgetToSendMoreEvents();
 *         } catch (Error | RuntimeException ex) {
 *             exceptions.stash (ex);
 *         }
 *
 *         // Exiting from 'try' statement will close ExceptionStash and
 *         // re-throw collected exception. If there are multiple exceptions,
 *         // all subsequent ones will be added as 'Throwable.addSuppressed()'.
 *     }
