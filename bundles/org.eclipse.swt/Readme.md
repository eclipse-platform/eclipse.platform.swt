org.eclipse.swt
===============

Main plug-in for the SWT user interface library.

Setting the classpath:
----------------------

To compile this project, you need to set the classpath specific for your operating and windowing system.
For this, rename one of the following files to `.classpath`:

* .classpath_win32 - Windows
* .classpath_cocoa_x86_64 - macOS Intel
* .classpath_cocoa_aarch64 - macOS Silicon
* .classpath_gtk - Linux and all Unix variants

Similar class paths renaming should be done for ./examples/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/

To see these files, you may have to remove the filter for ".* resources":
* In the Project Explorer: view menu > Customize View... > Filters
* In the Package Explorer: view menu > Filters...


Dependencies:
-------------

* **SWT Binaries**  

  Ensure that the fragment matching your windowingSystem.operatingSystem.cpuArchitecture  
  (e.g. org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_64) is open in your workspace.  
  The fragments provide the platform-specific native libraries.

Using Assertions:
----------------
Assertions are added to the code. These don't run in production, but they do when:
* JUnits are ran, they turn on assertions by default.
* If you run a java run configuration and add '-ea' to the 'VM Arguments'

Assertions look like:

	assert expression ;
	assert expression : msg ;

See: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html
