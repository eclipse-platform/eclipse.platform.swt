SWT Build 2.0 029 - Tuesday March 5, 2002

<h2>
<a NAME="New APIs"></a>New APIs</h2>

<b>Note:</b> The new Accessibility API is experimental, and will likely change.
<ul>
<li>Control.getAccessible() added</li>
<li>package <b>org.eclipse.swt.accessibility</b> added, containing the following classes:<ul>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>ACC</li>
<li>AccessibleListener</li>
<li>AccessibleAdapter</li>
<li>AccessibleEvent</li>
<li>AccessibleControlListener</li>
<li>AccessibleControlAdapter</li>
<li>AccessibleControlEvent</li>
</ul></li></ul>

Here are two examples that use the accessibility API:<ul>
<li>For a control with no child items:
<code><pre>
		button.getAccessible().addAccessibleListener(new AccessibleAdapter() {
			public void getName(AccessibleEvent e) {
				e.result = "My Button Label";
			}
		});
</pre></code></li>

<li>For a control that has child items:
<code><pre>
		list.getAccessible().addAccessibleListener(new AccessibleAdapter() {
			public void getName(AccessibleEvent e) {
				if (e.childID == ACC.CHILDID_SELF) {
					e.result = "My List Label";
				} else {
					e.result = "My List Item Label: " + list.getItem(e.childID);
				}
			}
		});
</pre></code></li></ul>
<b>Note:</b> The API involving the AccessibleControlXxx classes is more complex, and more likely to change. 
It is unlikely that application code will need to use it. 
It is primarily for the use of custom control implementors.

<code>FontData.setLocale(Locale)</code> has been changed to <code>FontData.setLocale(String)</code>.
<ul>
<li>
J2SE code can simply create a <code>Locale</code> and invoke <code>toString()</code> to pass it onto the new <code>setLocale</code>.
<li>
CLDC code will have to form a string matching the format specified in the J2SE javadoc of <code>java.util.Locale.toString()</code>.
</ul>
Example:
<blockquote><code><pre>
Locale[] locales = {
	Locale.US, new Locale("iw", "IL"), new Locale("ar", "SA"), new Locale("ru", "RU"),
	Locale.GERMAN, new Locale("ja", "JP"),
	null,
};
// old code: fd.setLocale(locales[i]);
String locale = (locales[i] != null ? locales[i].toString() : null);
fd.setLocale(locale);

<h2>
<a NAME="Behaviour change"></a>Behaviour change</h2>
<p>
1) The Drag Under effect of scrolling and expanding items as you drag over the <code>Tree</code> or <code>Table</code> has been added.  To enable this drag under effect, in the <code>DragOver</code> event set the <code>event.feedback</code> to have a bitwise combination of <code>DND.FEEDBACK_SCROLL, DND.FEEDBACK_EXPAND</code> and (<code>DND.FEEDBACK_SELECT, DND.FEEDBACK_INSERT_BEFORE, DND.FEEDBACK_INSERT_AFTER</code>) - where the last three items are mutually exclusive.
<blockquote><code><pre>
target.addDropListener (new DropTargetAdapter() {
	public void dragOver(DropTargetEvent event){
		event.feedback = DND.FEEDBACK_SELECT | DND.FEEDBACK_EXPAND | DND.FEEDBACK_SCROLL;
	}
}
</pre></code></blockquote></p>
<p>
2) On some operating systems it is preferred to move files in a drag and drop operation rather than for the drop target to make a copy of the file and the drag source to delete the original file.  The operation of moving the file is preformed by the drop target.  For these cases, the new drop type <code>DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE</code> has been added.  The Eclipse <code>DropTarget</code> does not support this behaviour but the Eclipse <code>DragSource</code> can recognize this scenario.  If another application has chosen to move the file rather than copy/delete, the <code>DragFinished</code> event on the <code>DragSource</code> will have an <code>event.detail</code> value of <code>DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE</code>.
<blockquote><code><pre>
source.addDragListener (new DragSourceAdapter () {
	public void dragFinished(DragSourceEvent event) {
		if (event.detail == DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE) {
			// clean up presentation but do not delete underlying file
		}
	}
}
</pre></code></blockquote></p>

SWT Build 2.0 004 - Thursday Sept 13, 2001

<h2>
<a NAME="API Behaviour change"></a>API Behaviour change</h2>
The behaviour of dispose for GCs has been modified such that attempting to dispose of
a GC on a control <em>after</em> the control has been disposed will generate an
SWTException.  This fixes an OS resource leak and potential GPF situation.
