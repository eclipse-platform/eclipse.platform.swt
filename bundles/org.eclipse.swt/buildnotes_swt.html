<h2> SWT Build 3.0 019 - Monday August 25, 2003 </h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="Breaking Changes"></a>Breaking Changes</h3>

<p>Keydown events now run before the work is done in the Operating System.  This means, for example, 
that if you hook a key down event in a text widget and inside the key down event, get the content of 
the text widget (Text.getText()), the content will not contain the key that was just typed.  
To get the content with the latest character you can use Display.asyncExec - this will run after 
the Operating System has processed the key down.  Note: in this case you probably should 
have been using the SWT.Modify or SWT.Verify event.</p>

<p>This change was made to support key bindings in Eclipse so that they could intercept
key events before any widget had a chance to process the character.</p>

<li>For a control with no child items:
<code><pre>
		button.getAccessible().addAccessibleListener(new AccessibleAdapter() {
			public void getName(AccessibleEvent e) {
				e.result = "My Button Label";
			}
		});
</pre></code></li>

<li>For a control that has child items:
<code><pre>
		list.getAccessible().addAccessibleListener(new AccessibleAdapter() {
			public void getName(AccessibleEvent e) {
				if (e.childID == ACC.CHILDID_SELF) {
					e.result = "My List Label";
				} else {
					e.result = "My List Item Label: " + list.getItem(e.childID);
				}
			}
		});
</pre></code></li></ul>
<b>Note:</b> The API involving the AccessibleControlXxx classes is more complex, and more likely to change. 
It is unlikely that application code will need to use it. 
It is primarily for the use of custom control implementors.

<h3>
<a NAME="API Changes"></a>API Changes</h3>
<code>FontData.setLocale(Locale)</code> has been changed to <code>FontData.setLocale(String)</code>.
<ul>
<li>
J2SE code can simply create a <code>Locale</code> and invoke <code>toString()</code> to pass it onto the new <code>setLocale</code>.
<li>
CLDC code will have to form a string matching the format specified in the J2SE javadoc of <code>java.util.Locale.toString()</code>.
</ul>
Example:
<blockquote><code><pre>
Locale[] locales = {
	Locale.US, new Locale("iw", "IL"), new Locale("ar", "SA"), new Locale("ru", "RU"),
	Locale.GERMAN, new Locale("ja", "JP"),
	null,
};
// old code: fd.setLocale(locales[i]);
String locale = (locales[i] != null ? locales[i].toString() : null);
fd.setLocale(locale);
</pre></code></blockquote></p>

<h2> SWT Build 2.0 010 - Thursday October 25, 2001 </h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="Behaviour change"></a>Behaviour change</h3>
<p>
1) The Drag Under effect of scrolling and expanding items as you drag over the <code>Tree</code> or <code>Table</code> has been added.  To enable this drag under effect, in the <code>DragOver</code> event set the <code>event.feedback</code> to have a bitwise combination of <code>DND.FEEDBACK_SCROLL, DND.FEEDBACK_EXPAND</code> and (<code>DND.FEEDBACK_SELECT, DND.FEEDBACK_INSERT_BEFORE, DND.FEEDBACK_INSERT_AFTER</code>) - where the last three items are mutually exclusive.
<blockquote><code><pre>
target.addDropListener (new DropTargetAdapter() {
	public void dragOver(DropTargetEvent event){
		event.feedback = DND.FEEDBACK_SELECT | DND.FEEDBACK_EXPAND | DND.FEEDBACK_SCROLL;
	}
}
</pre></code></blockquote></p>
<p>
2) On some operating systems it is preferred to move files in a drag and drop operation rather than for the drop target to make a copy of the file and the drag source to delete the original file.  The operation of moving the file is preformed by the drop target.  For these cases, the new drop type <code>DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE</code> has been added.  The Eclipse <code>DropTarget</code> does not support this behaviour but the Eclipse <code>DragSource</code> can recognize this scenario.  If another application has chosen to move the file rather than copy/delete, the <code>DragFinished</code> event on the <code>DragSource</code> will have an <code>event.detail</code> value of <code>DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE</code>.
<blockquote><code><pre>
source.addDragListener (new DragSourceAdapter () {
	public void dragFinished(DragSourceEvent event) {
		if (event.detail == DND.DROP_TARGET_MOVE) {
			// clean up presentation but do not delete underlying file
		}
	}
}
</pre></code></blockquote></p>
