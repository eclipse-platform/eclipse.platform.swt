<h4>Eclipse plug-in based on the SWT Browser throws exception</h4>
<p>The SWT Browser widget uses a platform-specific web browser to render HTML.
The org.eclipse.swt.SWTError exception (&quot;No more handles&quot;) is thrown
on platforms that don't meet the requirements for running the Browser widget.
Supported platforms and prerequisites are listed on the SWT FAQ item <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-swt-home/faq.html#browserplatforms">&quot;Which
platforms are supported by the SWT Browser?&quot;</a>.</p>
<h4>Eclipse crashes on RedHat Linux 9 (GTK+ only)</h4>
<p>Users of the Bluecurve theme shipped with RedHat Linux 9 may experience problems running Eclipse.  
These problems may include crashes or reduced performance.
(bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38305">38305</a>,

<p>We recommend changing to a different theme.
Under GNOME, open RedHat Menu > Preferences > Theme.  Select a theme other than Bluecurve.  All applications should update at this point.
Under KDE, open RedHatMenu > Run Command...  And then type in "gnome-theme-manager" and click "Run".  Select a theme other than Bluecurve.  The selection may jump to "Custom Theme" afterward; this is normal, and happens because the GNOME window manager is not running.  All GTK+ applications should update to the new theme at this point.

<h4>Eclipse hangs when pasting from an unresponsive application (GTK only)</h4>
<p>If the application that is supplying the clipboard material is unresponsive,
the paste operation hangs Eclipse for several minutes. This situation can be
encountered when copying from an Eclipse target workbench, suspending the target
workbench at a breakpoint and pasting into the hosting Eclipse workbench. (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=44915">44915</a>)</p>
<h4>Running SWT App (Mac OS X Carbon only)</h4>
<p>On Mac OS X Carbon, in order to run an SWT application it is necessary to specify the argument "-XstartOnFirstThread" to the Java VM. This
argument is only supported in JDK 1.4.2_05 and higher.</p>
<h4>Drag and drop on Mac (Mac OS X Carbon only)</h4>
<p>The Mac OS X Carbon implementation of SWT does not support dragging from an SWT application to another application. (bug
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68212">68212</a>)</p>
<h4>Components in SWT_AWT are not displayed (Motif only)</h4>
<p>On Motif systems (verified on Linux and Solaris) problems have been reported
by some developers in the support for embedding AWT widgets within SWT layouts.
These can range from the AWT widgets not being properly displayed to Java VM
crashes. The cause(s) of these problems has not yet been determined. (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=68353">68353</a>)</p>
<h4>Can't expand/collapse TableTree item with mouse (GTK only)</h4>
<p>Under certain conditions and on certain versions of GTK, TableTree items,
such as those found in Property Sheets, cannot be expanded or collapsed using
the mouse. The workaround is to use the right and left arrow keys. (bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38855">38855</a>)</p>
<h4> Unable to drag data between
applications in simplified Chinese locale (Motif only)</h4>
<p>When configured for the simplified Chinese locale, it is not possible to
drag data between applications running on the Motif window system. This is a
known limitation of the Open Motif library. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=29777">29777</a>)</p>
<h4> Crash when attempting to
launch file browser (AIX Motif only)</h4>
<p>There is a known AIX graphics bug affecting certain levels of AIX
releases. Ensure that the AIX install includes the necessary service updates as
described in the &quot;Install notes/requirements for Eclipse on AIX&quot;
attachment to the Eclipse bug report. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34524">34524</a>)</p>
<h4> Available colors on 8-bit
Linux (Linux only)</h4>
<p>Typically, in Gnome Linux installs running with 8-bit visuals (i.e. 256
color mode), before the Eclipse application is started there are no free colors.
This may mean that Eclipse is unable to allocate the default widget background
color, causing it to display a white background. The functionality, however, is
otherwise unaffected.</p>
<h4> List and ComboBox on Windows
NT (Windows NT only)</h4>
<p>On Windows NT only, you should avoid creating items in a <code>List</code>
or <code>ComboBox</code> with strings longer than 1000 characters. Doing so may
result in a General Protection Fault. This has been fixed in more recent
versions of Windows.</p>
<h4> Excessive CPU
consumption&nbsp; (Linux GTK only)</h4>
<p>When using Linux GTK 2.2.1, there are some scenarios where the CPU usage
goes to 100% for no good reason. When this occurs, resizing or closing the
dialog seems to return the CPU usage to normal. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=31525">31525</a>)</p>
<h4>IME-related crash (Linux
Motif only)</h4>
<p>When using Linux Motif and GB18030 IME &quot;chinput&quot;, Eclipse can
crash if the IME client window is left open when the parent window is disposed.
(bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32045">32045</a>)</p>
<h4> Using IBM J9 VM (Photon and
AIX)</h4>
<p>On QNX Photon and IBM AIX, the SWT library will not be found when running
with an IBM J9 1.5 VM. This is a bug in the IBM J9 class library in version 1.5.
You can workaround this problem by adding the SWT library directory to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.</p>
<h4> Missing permissions for SWT
native libraries in workspace (HP-UX only)</h4>
<p>When retrieving the SWT Motif fragment into an Eclipse workspace, the
permissions of the native libraries are reset. This creates a problem on HP-UX
because shared libraries need to have execute permission. Attempting to
self-host with this fragment throws an UnsatisfiedLinkError...Permission Denied
error. You must manually change the permissions to make these libraries
accessible (assume the workspace is at <code>/workspace</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>cd /workspace/org.eclipse.swt.motif/os/hpux/PA_RISC<br>
    chmod 555 *.sl</code></p>
  </blockquote>
