<h2>SWT Example - Layout Overview</h2>

<p>	
This example is a simple demonstration of common SWT layouts. 
It consists of a tab folder where each tab allows the 
user to interact with a different SWT layout.
The user can insert widgets into a layout and set the values of the layout data
using a property sheet.  When the user has a suitable arrangement, code can be
generated by clicking on the Code button.
</p>

<h3>Running the example</h3>

<p>From the Window menu select Show View --> Other.  
In the Show View dialog, expand SWT Examples and select the
view named SWT Layouts.  A view titled SWT Layouts will appear in your current perspective.
