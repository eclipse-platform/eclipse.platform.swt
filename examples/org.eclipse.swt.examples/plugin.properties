plugin.SWTStandaloneExampleSet.name = SWT Standalone Examples Plugin

launchcategory.SWTStandaloneExamples.name = Standalone
launchcategory.SWTStandaloneExamples.description = \
	A collection of Standard Widget Toolkit examples that run independant \
	of the Eclipse Platform.\n\n\
	These examples may take a moment to start while a new runtime environment \
	is created in the background.

launchitem.AddressBook.name = Address Book
launchitem.AddressBook.description = \
	The AddressBook example shows how the org.eclipse.swt.Table class can be used to \
	present tabular information.\n\n\
	The application can save and load address books, sort the entries, search for strings within \
	the fields and perform other operations that would typically be found in this kind of application.

launchitem.FileViewer.name = File Viewer
launchitem.FileViewer.description = \
	The File Viewer example shows how a simple application can be implemented using SWT.\n\n\
	This application provides the ability to browse files and folders and manipulate via Drag & Drop.  \
	It includes the use of alternate threads for long actions and demonstrates the use of the Tree, \
	Table, Toolbar and Program.

launchitem.HoverHelp.name = Hover Help
launchitem.HoverHelp.description = \
	The Hover Help example shows how to implement custom tooltips and hover help support \
	on a number of different SWT controls including Buttons, TableItems, ToolItems and TreeItems.\n\n\
	The example implements its own tooltip and hover help support.  \
	To see the custom tooltips in action, hover over an item or button in the UI.  \
	Notice that images appear in the left-hand corner of the tooltip, unlike standard SWT tooltips \
	created using setToolTip() on those widgets that natively support them.\n\n\
	To see the custom hover help in action, hover over an item or button in the UI as before until \
	the tooltip is displayed.  Without moving the pointer, hit F1.  A new Shell will pop up with the \
	extended hover help information for the UI element in question.

launchitem.HelloWorld2.description = \
	This example builds on HelloWorld1 and demonstrates the minimum amount of code required to \
	open an SWT Shell with a Label and process the events.

launchitem.HelloWorld3.name = Hello World (3)

	blending and can save these changes to a file.

launchitem.JavaViewer.name = Java Syntax Viewer
launchitem.JavaViewer.description = \
	This example demonstrates how to implement a user-defined line styler for the StyledText widget.\n\n\
	The example provides a typical editor interface.  \
	To see the effect of the line styler, open a *.java file.  \
	When the contents of the file are displayed in the editor area, notice that the keywords have been highlighted.
