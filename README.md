# About

SWT is a cross-platform GUI library for JVM based desktop applications.
The best known SWT-based application is [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org).

For more information about SWT, visit the [official SWT page](https://eclipse.dev/eclipse/swt/).

## Getting Started

SWT comes with platform-specific jar files.
Download them from https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/index.html and add the jar file to your classpath.

### Example
![Example](example.png)
```java
import org.eclipse.swt.SWT;
import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData;
import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridLayout;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Button;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text;

public class HelloWorld {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		final Display display = new Display();

		final Shell shell = new Shell(display);
		shell.setText("Hello World");
		shell.setLayout(new GridLayout(2, false));

		final Label label = new Label(shell, SWT.LEFT);
		label.setText("Your &Name:");
		label.setLayoutData(new GridData(SWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, false, false));

		final Text text = new Text(shell, SWT.BORDER | SWT.SINGLE);
		final GridData data = new GridData(SWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, true, false);
		data.minimumWidth = 120;
		text.setLayoutData(data);

		final Button button = new Button(shell, SWT.PUSH);
		button.setText("Say Hello");
		shell.setDefaultButton(button);
		button.setLayoutData(new GridData(SWT.END, SWT.CENTER, false, false, 2, 1));

		final Label output = new Label(shell, SWT.CENTER);
		output.setLayoutData(new GridData(SWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, true, false, 2, 1));

		button.addListener(SWT.Selection, event -> {
			String name = text.getText().trim();
			if (name.length() == 0) {
				name = "world";
			}
			output.setText("Hello " + name + "!");
		});

		shell.setSize(shell.computeSize(SWT.DEFAULT, SWT.DEFAULT));
		shell.open();

		while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
			if (!display.readAndDispatch()) {
				display.sleep();
			}
		}

		display.dispose();
	}
}
```
First, a `Display` is created which is something like the central place of all GUI-related code.
Then a `Shell` is created which in our example is a top-level window.
Then all child controls and listeners are created, including their layout information.
Finally, we set the window's size determines by its child controls and open the window.
The `while`-loop processes all GUI related events until the shell is disposed which happens when closing.
Before exiting, any claimed GUI resources needs to be freed.

## Contact

Contact the project developers via GitHub:

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/discussions) - For questions and general discussions
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/issues) - For bug reports and feature requests

You can register bugs and feature requests in the GitHub Issue Tracker. Remember that contributions are always welcome!

Please bear in mind that this project is almost entirely developed by volunteers. If you do not provide the implementation yourself (or pay someone to do it for you), the bug might never get fixed. If it is a serious bug, other people than you might care enough to provide a fix.

**Note:** SWT used to track ongoing development and issues in [Bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=Platform&component=SWT), but we now use GitHub Issues and Discussions.


# Prototyping on a Single, Cross-Platform SWT Implementation

There is current work on evaluating the feasibility of achieving a single, OS-agnostic implementation of SWT in order to reduce maintenance efforts, enable better look and feel, and improve configurability.
The work on these prototypes and their documentation can currently be found in a dedicated GitHub organization: https://github.com/swt-initiative31

Actual prototyping work has been started on four technologies: Skia with Visual Class Library (VCL), Skia with custom-rendered widgets, GTK, and Swing\
The prototypes for the following technologies are still under investigation, are further developed and can be tried out here:
- Skia with custom-drawn widgets: https://github.com/swt-initiative31/prototype-skija
- Cross-platform GTK: https://github.com/swt-initiative31/prototype-gtk
